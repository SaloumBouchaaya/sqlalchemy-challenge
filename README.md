# sqlalchemy-challenge

# Throught this challange I worked with two CSV & one sqlite file,gathered inormation on temperature observations and percipiation in Hawaii.
# With that information I put togther a bar graph with percipitation data using the the last year of info we have & created a histogram plotting the temperature observations and frequency

# The climate anlaysis about the area and gathered data from 9 stations. 

# At the end I created an API with multiple routes. Those routes will lead to pages that give information about the precipitation analysis, the list of stations, temperature observations, and summary statistics.
